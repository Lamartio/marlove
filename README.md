# Introduction



- Versioning: Proper Git usage with messages confirming to: https://cbea.ms/git-commit/ 
- Code style:
    - Extensive use of lambda and they are considered a type (like String and Int). 
    - Mostly using expression body, since it shows clearly that the function is a 'pure' function
    - Using extension functions, since they are pure functions (but that with a parameter that is 'this')
- Naming: By Kotlin convention
- Testing: 
- Failures: https://www.morling.dev/blog/whats-in-a-good-error-message/
